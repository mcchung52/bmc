things to improve/fix
=====================
-'browse' button and input text box to fit in other input's length
-unit test
-focus inputbox on x=clear
-spinner icon doesn't appear

======
1. using positioning
-x to clear fix on 12px from right, when on smaller scrn, to stay on right 

2. using positioning (see CSS)
-save&cancel buttons to stick at bottom
-scrollable

3. overall positioning with 1 & 2
